This solution creates a fixed navigation bar at the top of the page that changes its background color as you scroll through different sections of the page. Each section has its unique color, and the navigation bar updates to match the current section that is in view. In addition, the links in the navigation bar change color on hover, providing a visually engaging user experience.

Features:
Fixed Navigation Bar: The navigation bar is fixed at the top of the page, making it always visible while scrolling through the content.
Section-Based Color Change: As the user scrolls to different sections, the background color of the navigation bar dynamically changes to match the section’s background color.
Smooth Transitions: The color transitions for both the background and hover effects are smooth, enhancing user experience.
Hover Effect on Links: The navigation links change color when hovered over to indicate interactivity.

HTML Structure:
The HTML consists of a header element containing the navigation menu. Each menu item links to a corresponding section on the page (e.g., Home, About, Services, Contact). Below the navigation, there are four sections, each occupying the full viewport height (100vh).
Each section is wrapped in a section tag and is identified by a unique id attribute (e.g., id="home", id="about"). These IDs are used to link the navigation menu items and also to determine which section is currently visible for changing the navigation bar’s color.


CSS Styling:
The CSS styles the navigation bar and the page sections. Key features include:
Fixed Position: The navigation bar is fixed to the top using position: fixed;, ensuring it remains visible while scrolling.
Background Colors: Each section has a different background color (e.g., #ff6f61 for the Home section and #4caf50 for About), and the navbar changes to these colors as the user scrolls through each section.
Hover Effect: The links in the navigation bar change color when hovered over, enhancing interactivity with a smooth color transition (transition: color 0.3s ease-in-out;).


JavaScript Interactivity:
The JavaScript adds scroll-based interactivity to the navigation menu. Here's the breakdown of the logic:
Section Detection: As the user scrolls, the script checks which section is currently in view. This is done by comparing the scroll position (window.scrollY) with each section’s top offset (section.offsetTop).
Color Change: Based on the section in view, the navigation bar’s background color is updated. The sectionColors object stores the color for each section, and the background color of the navbar is dynamically set using navbar.style.backgroundColor.
Event Listener: The scroll event listener triggers the changeNavbarColor function, ensuring that the navbar’s background color updates as the user scrolls through the page.
